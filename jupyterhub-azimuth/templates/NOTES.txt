JupyterHub provides a multi-user [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment,
ideal for classrooms and research labs.

Each user gets their own notebook server and storage allocation, where they can
work independently of each other.

If JupyterHub is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with autoscaling of nodes, then
a new node may be created on demand to fulfil a user request for a notebook server,
if there is not sufficient space on the cluster. When idle notebook servers are culled,
the Kubernetes cluster can then scale back down.
